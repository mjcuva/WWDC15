<h2>Hidrate</h2>
<p>For a hackathon, in under three days, a small team I worked with created a water bottle that tracks how much water you drink during the day and syncs it with your iPhone. It allowed you to track your water consumption over time, and tell you how much you should drink based on your biometrics. We placed third out of over 20 teams.</p>
